# Types

These types are Interium's LUA API that can help you while creating your luas.

## Installation

Firstly, you need to install [this Lua Language server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)
which will lint your code and support [Types.lua](../interium/Types.lua).

Secondly, you need to copy [Types.lua](../interium/Types.lua) file into your [Interium LUA folder](https://vk.com/topic-42366670_40421479) and open VS Code in [Interium LUA folder](https://vk.com/topic-42366670_40421479).

## That's it!

Now VS Code will support Interium's LUA API and give you hints when you will type, for example, `Render.`.
