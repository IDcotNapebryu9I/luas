# json

These files are `JSON objects`, which represents **all available events and weapon types** in CS:GO.

These `JSON objects` were auto-generated according to [CS:GO's official VScript page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/CSGO_VScript_%E8%8C%83%E4%BE%8B).

Content:
* [events.json](events.json): all *unavailable* and available events for CS:GO.
* [weapon-types.json](weapon-types.json): all *(?)* weapon types for CS:GO.

*This folder is just for me searching for interesting or new events.*
